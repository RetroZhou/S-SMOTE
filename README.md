# S-SMOTE
S-SMOTE expands a few class boundaries through a random generation module that fuses SMOTE, Borderline-SMOTE and G-SMOTE techniques, a $k$-nearest neighbor mechanism that dynamically filters noisy samples, and an adaptive weighted selection mechanism that retains high-quality synthetic samples.
